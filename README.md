# Tic-Tac-Toe
Mini Game Project
"Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where opponents take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their designated symbols, typically 'X' and 'O'. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols. Players must strategize to block their opponent's moves while aiming to create their own winning sequences. Despite its simple rules, Tic Tac Toe offers engaging gameplay that challenges players' critical thinking and foresight.
